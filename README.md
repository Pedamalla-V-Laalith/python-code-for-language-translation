# python-code-for-language-translation
My first git repository, which has a primitive code written in python, which translates sentences of one language from another
<br>
I wrote this code in such a way that it can take any language text and translate it into a language of your choice
<br>
you can even translate the sentences you speak, but you can only do it if you speak (say your sentence) in English
<br>
the choice will lie with you whether you want to use text to text translation or voice to text translation
